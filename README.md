The aim of the subject project is to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology 
scans. 

The data provided is a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset. 
The original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented here 
does not contain duplicates.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Pretrained Model (ResNet) were applied for solving this problem.
